## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  Functions can return a value or are created to perform a type of operation.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A function has a name, parameter(s) and a code block that can contain a return value.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  Function name and parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function definition uses more code. It has a code block and return value.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are placeholders for values that will be used when a function is called.
  Arguments values put into functions when called.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They describe the type of values you can use.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Returns a result and exits the function.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  Parameters and their types are set within parentheses. The function type is added before the function arrow. The code block follows. All of that is assigned to a variable.

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  It will automatically return.
